Analyze the codebase for performance optimization opportunities. Consider:

1. Algorithm efficiency (time and space complexity)
2. Database queries (N+1 problems, missing indexes, inefficient joins)
3. Network calls (batching, caching, parallel requests)
4. Memory usage and potential leaks
5. Bundle size and code splitting opportunities
6. Rendering performance (unnecessary re-renders, virtualization)
7. Build and compile time improvements

Provide specific recommendations with estimated impact and implementation difficulty.
