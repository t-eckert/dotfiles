# Thomas Eckert's Dotfiles

This repository helps me unify development environments between multiple systems. It contains configuration files for applications I use and small sharp tools I've written to make my work more effective.

## Installation

## Configs

## Tools

I've unified my tooling around simple Go applications. They are all available in [`tools`](./tools).
